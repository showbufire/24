a simple haskell solution to [24 Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game), inspired by *The Countdown Problem* in [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/book.html).

It doesn't support solutions using non-integers, yet. For example, the program won't be able to solve `[1, 5, 5, 5]`.
